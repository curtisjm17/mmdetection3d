My implementation of an inference and visualization pipeline for 3D Object Detection can be found in 3D_Object_Detection.ipynb. In order to run this Jupyter Notebook, you must first install the required supporting libraries. These library requirements can be found here: https://mmdetection3d.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html. Once these requirement are satsified, clone the this repo and install it:

git clone https://github.com/curtisjm17/mmdetection3d.git
cd mmdetection3d
pip install -v -e . 

From here it is as simply as running through the Jupyter Notebook.
